A writer for The Daily Beast was accused of outing gay Olympic athletes after an article was published on Thursday morning about dating apps and sex in Rio’s Olympic Village. Nico Hines, who identifies himself as a straight, married man, was on assignment when he decided to investigate who uses the dating apps Tinder, Grindr, and Bumble. Within the first 60 minutes, Hines claims to have scored three dates and proceeded to find out how easy it is to get laid.

There are several reasons the article offended a lot of people. Hines’s first mistake was signing up for Grindr, and many readers questioned if it is journalism for a straight man to log into Grindr, a hook-up app specifically designed for gay men, and then write about what happened next.

“No prizes for guessing that Grindr proved more of an instant hookup success than Bumble or Tinder, which is owned by IAC, the parent company of The Daily Beast,” Hines writes.

Hines then goes into detail of his matches on Grindr. The men have six packs and some use their bio to state their explicit intentions in Rio.
